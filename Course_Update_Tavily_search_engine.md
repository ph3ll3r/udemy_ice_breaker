# New Educational Announcement as of April 7, 2024
 
### Hi Peter, an announcement has been made from Eden, instructor of LangChain- Develop LLM powered applications with LangChain. 

I made some significant improvements to the course materials to enhance your learning experience and would make the ice-breaker project easier to follow
ICE BREAKER REPOSITORY UPDATES
-	https://github.com/emarco177/ice_breaker
-	Using LangChain 0.1.14 (latest) - including all dependencies in Pipfile.lock
-	**Removed SerAPIWrapper and instead used Tavily search engine made for GenAI applications (cleaner and more free credits)**
-	Cleaned HTML to be much simpler and got rid of the CSS file
-	Introduced cleaner LCEL code
-	General refactor
-	For those wishing to engage with the course without using credits, added a GistFile implementation for your convenience 

### *I am Currently re-filming the entire section, and adding it by April 23rd, 2024* 
FOR THOSE WHO ARE TAKING THE COURSE NOW:
-	While Iv'e updated most of our videos to align with LangChain 0.1.14, there might be some discrepancies that could lead to compatibility issues, such as incorrect import errors.
### Please bear with us during this transition :) 
- I would suggest that you use the main file as a reference point- and as always would highly reccomend joining the discord community for assistance
### FOR THOSE WHO ARE TAKING THE COURSE NOW:
- Upcoming Additions:  excited to announce that a new section will be added to the course within the next few weeks. Stay tuned for more enriching content!
